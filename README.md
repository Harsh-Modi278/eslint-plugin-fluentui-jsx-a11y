# Project

## ***Under Construction***

A set of eslint rules against [FluentUI](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/0.64.0) to prevent common accessibility issues.

## ESLint

This plugin was generated with The ESLint generator for Yeoman: [eslint/generator-eslint](https://github.com/eslint/generator-eslint).

### eslint:plugin

```sh
yo eslint:plugin
```

### eslint:rule

If you want to create a new ESLint rule, make sure you're in the top-level directory of an ESLint repo clone or an ESLint plugin and type:

```sh
yo eslint:rule
```
